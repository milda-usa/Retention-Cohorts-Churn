# Weekly Retention Cohort Analysis

This repository contains SQL code and insights for conducting a weekly retention cohort analysis. The analysis focuses on subscribers' retention behavior over six weeks, starting from their subscription cohort week.

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to generate a retention matrix that shows how many subscribers started their subscriptions in a particular week (cohort week) and how many remained active in subsequent weeks (week 0 to week 6).

## Insights

### Key Findings
1. **Retention Trends**:
   - The number of subscribers tends to decrease over subsequent weeks, which is typical in subscription-based models.
   - The first week shows the highest drop in active users compared to the cohort size.

2. **Seasonal or Weekly Variations**:
   - Some cohort weeks show stronger retention, possibly indicating external factors like promotions or seasonal impacts.

### Recommendations
- **Focus on Early Retention**: Implement strategies to improve retention in the first week, as it has the steepest drop.
- **Analyze High-Performing Cohorts**: Investigate what worked well for cohorts with better retention rates and replicate those strategies.

## Results

Excel file with SQL code and visualizations is attached in this repository.
